**I’m Chris Rafuse – Full Stack & AI/ML Solutions Architect**

I blend 25+ years of web evolution (Web 1.0→4.0 and beyond) with bleeding-edge AI/ML, quantum-adjacent vision, and industrial-design rigor. My mission? To architect intelligent, high-impact systems that fuel exponential ROI, unlock new markets, and outpace every competitor.

### What I Do

* **Design & Build Human-Centered Interfaces**
  I craft responsive front-ends with React.js, Angular, Vue 3, HTML5/CSS3, and WebAssembly—always ensuring accessibility, performance, and an intuitive user experience.
* **Architect Scalable Back-Ends & APIs**
  From Node.js/Express and Next.js to Spring Boot, Django, and FastAPI, I deliver resilient microservices, serverless functions, and real-time pipelines.
* **Engineer AI/ML Solutions**
  I fine-tune LLMs, build multi-model RAG workflows, and deploy production-ready pipelines using PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, scikit-learn, and AWS SageMaker. Explainable AI, ethical guardrails, and data-driven decisioning are staples.
* **Automate & Orchestrate Agentic Workflows**
  I leverage GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Aider, Apache Airflow, and Prefect to design autonomous agents and pipeline automations that amplify team productivity and eliminate manual toil.
* **Lead Cloud & DevOps Practices**
  On AWS (Lambda, EKS, SageMaker), GCP (Vertex AI, Cloud Run), and Azure ML, I implement Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm) and robust CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) for seamless, secure delivery.
